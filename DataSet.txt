Because its not that simple to get a Dataset to train CNN to recognize Alphabets and Numbers together, but they are always done seperatly.
so I combined "A_Z Handwritten Data" and "mnist" datasets to create a new dataset containing both Alphabets and Numeric values.
you can find the Dataset at LINK: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yD6xaaA3FCJlLjoZlrw3TjnUlErVQtLU/view?usp=sharing
